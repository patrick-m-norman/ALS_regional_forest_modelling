# LITCHI_GRID_SETUP.txt - Instructions for Litchi Grid Generation & OpenDroneMap Processing

This document outlines the steps required to generate Litchi flight grids and process drone imagery using OpenDroneMap. Please read carefully before proceeding.

**1. Prerequisites & Environment Setup**

*   **Bash Environment:** You're going to need a Bash environment. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):** Install WSL and a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu). This is the recommended approach for Windows users.
    *   **Linux Installation:** If you're already using a Linux distribution, you've already got this covered.
*   **R Environment:**  You'll need R installed.  It's recommended to use a dedicated R environment like RStudio.
*   **OpenDroneMap:** OpenDroneMap (ODM) needs to be installed.  Follow the official ODM installation instructions for your operating system: [https://www.opendronemap.org/](https://www.opendronemap.org/)

**2. Setting up the Litchi Grid Generation**

*   **R Script:** You'll be using the `auto_litchi_grid.R` script to generate the Litchi flight grid.
*   **Template CSV:** The script uses a template CSV file to define the grid parameters.  Ensure you have a suitable template CSV file available.  The script will likely have instructions on the expected format of this file.
*   **Running the Script:**
    1.  Open R or RStudio.
    2.  Set your working directory to the folder containing `auto_litchi_grid.R` and the template CSV file.
    3.  Run the script: `source("auto_litchi_grid.R")`
    4.  The script will generate a CSV file containing the Litchi flight lines. This CSV file can be directly loaded into the Litchi Mission Hub.

**3. Drone Flight and Image Collection**

*   Load the generated CSV file into the Litchi Mission Hub.
*   Fly the drone according to the generated flight plan.
*   Ensure that all images are collected and stored.

**4. OpenDroneMap Processing**

*   **Folder Structure:** The ODM processing requires a specific folder structure. For each site, create the following:
    *   **Site Folder:** A folder representing the site (e.g., "Site1", "Site2").
    *   **Images Folder:** Inside the site folder, create a folder named "images". This folder should contain all the drone photos collected for that site.
*   **ODM Script:** You'll be using the provided OpenDroneMap bash script to automatically process the images.
*   **Running the ODM Script:**
    1.  Open a terminal.
    2.  Navigate to the directory containing the ODM bash script.
    3.  Run the script. The script will automatically loop through all site folders and process the images within the "images" folders.
    4.  The processed data (point clouds and orthophotos) will be generated within each site folder.

**5. Troubleshooting**

*   **ODM Installation:** Ensure that OpenDroneMap is correctly installed and configured. Refer to the official ODM documentation for troubleshooting.
*   **Folder Structure:** Double-check that the folder structure is correct. The ODM script relies on a consistent folder structure to find the images.
*   **Image Format:** Ensure that the drone images are in a format supported by OpenDroneMap (e.g., JPG, PNG).
*   **Memory Requirements:** ODM processing can be memory-intensive. Ensure that your system has sufficient RAM.
*   **Script Output:** Pay attention to the output of the ODM script. It will often provide clues about what went wrong.
